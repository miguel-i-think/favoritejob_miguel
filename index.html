<h1>Python Snake Game</h1>
<p>I've never worked professionally as a programmer nor have I ever really done mnay personal projects either. Most of my projects have been assignments I've done for class. My favorite project, however, was a snake game I made when I was still learning to program. At the time I started off with python since it's one of the easiest languages to get into.</p>
<p>However, once class was coming to the end, I wanted to challenge myself with what I learned. Of course I had to look up some stuff we did not look at in class but I got started. It took me a long time, maybe 6-8 hours, but eventually I finish my little snake game. Sadly, the file was lost when I build my current computer but I'm sure it's still in a hard drive somewhere.</p>
<p>This ended up being my favorite project just because it was the start of everything. Now I could code it much faster and simpler but I guess it's more nostalgic than anything, it showed me that I could do what I've always wanted to do, and it snowballed into realizing I enjoy hardware a lot more than software.</p>
